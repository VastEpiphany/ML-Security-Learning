# Machine Learning Security Learning Footprint

---

This is the repo that contains my thoughts for this semester's ML Security course. Basically I would do a quickly review of what I've just learned and then dealing with my project.



## Explanation

- The Lecture notes will not be provided in this repo as they are the property of the professor and we should respect intellectual property rights.

- The Final Project seems a little bit of thrilling for me, and I'll upload some of the solutions ASAP after the Deadline. (Maybe?)
